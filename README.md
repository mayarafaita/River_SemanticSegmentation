# River_SemanticSegmentation
This dataset is composed of large and narrow rivers used for semantic segmentation. 
The orthorectified aerial images at high spatial resolution (1 m) are available (http://www.mapeiasp.sp.gov.br/) and have to be solicited (http://www.governoaberto.sp.gov.br/como-utilizar/)
Labeled data is available in this repository for testing new automatic river mapping models.
If you have any questions, please contact (mayarafaita@gmail.com).
